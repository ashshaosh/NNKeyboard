NNKeyboard is a UIControl subclass that allows the easy creation of visually appealing but highly customizable piano keyboards.

NNKeyboard currently uses Intuit Animation Engine.

The demo project uses UIColor+MLPFlatColors.

TODO: 
-	Draw keys programmatically (remove reliance on bitmaps)
-	Remove reliance on IntuitAnimationEngine
-	Include basic midi playback functionality as part of the class
-	Easy mode for creating a keyboard (dependent on device width, just specify height and y-origin).


Instructions

See demo project for multiple examples.
